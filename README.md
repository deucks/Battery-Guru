Battery Guru
===================
An app created in early 2015 for Windows Phone platform. The app does as its name suggests, it shows you exactly how your battery is being used and how long itâ€™s going to last. The predictions are incredibly accurate, as the app records data every minute, unlike most similar apps that do it every 30 minutes.

Compatible with Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 10

The app is still live in the store.
